# finger-counting-project-python
This project is a Python-based computer vision application that counts all 10 fingers (both hands) in real time using a webcam. It uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and OpenCV for video processing.  The system detects both left and right hands, identifies raised fingers, and displays the total finger count (0–10) live on the screen.
